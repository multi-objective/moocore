# Introduction

This webpage documents the `moocore` R package. There is also a
[`moocore` Python
package](https://multi-objective.github.io/moocore/python/)

The goal of the [**moocore**
project](https://github.com/multi-objective/moocore/) is to collect and
document fast implementations of core mathematical functions and
algorithms for multi-objective optimization and make them available to
different programming languages via similar interfaces. These functions
include:

- Generate and transform nondominated sets.
- Identify and filter dominated vectors.
- Quality metrics such as (weighted) hypervolume, epsilon, IGD, etc.
- Computation of the Empirical Attainment Function. The empirical
  attainment function (EAF) describes the probabilistic distribution of
  the outcomes obtained by a stochastic algorithm in the objective
  space.

Most critical functionality is implemented in C, with the R and Python
packages providing convenient interfaces to the C code.

**Keywords**: empirical attainment function, summary attainment
surfaces, EAF differences, multi-objective optimization, bi-objective
optimization, performance measures, performance assessment

## Download and installation

The **moocore** package is implemented in R. Therefore, a basic
knowledge of R is recommended to make use of all features.

The first step before installing the **moocore** package is to [install
R](https://cran.r-project.org/). Once R is installed in the system,
there are two methods for installing the **moocore** package:

1.  Install within R (automatic download, internet connection required).
    Invoke R, then

    ``` r
        install.packages("moocore")
    ```

2.  [Download the **moocore** package from
    CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=moocore) (you may also need
    to download and install first the [package
    matrixStats](https://cran.r-project.org/package=matrixStats)), and
    invoke at the command-line:

    ``` bash
        R CMD INSTALL <package>
    ```

    where `<package>` is one of the three versions available: `.tar.gz`
    (Unix/BSD/GNU/Linux), `.tgz` (MacOS X), or `.zip` (Windows).

Search the [R documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/faqs.html) if
you need more help to install an R package on your system.

Compiled command-line executables for various purposes can be found
under `system.file(package="moocore", "bin")`.

If you wish to be notified of bugfixes and new versions, please
subscribe to the [low-volume
emo-list](https://lists.dei.uc.pt/mailman/listinfo/emo-list), where
announcements will be made.

## GitHub (Development version)

If you wish to try the development version, you can install it by
executing the following command within the R console:

``` r
install.packages('moocore', repos = c('https://multi-objective.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

## Usage

Once the **moocore** package is installed, the following R commands will
give more information:

``` r
    library(moocore)
    ?eaf
    ?read_datasets
```
