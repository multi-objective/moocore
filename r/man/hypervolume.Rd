\usage{
hypervolume(x, reference, maximise = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{matrix()}|\code{data.frame()}\cr Matrix or data frame of numerical
values, where each row gives the coordinates of a point.}

\item{reference}{\code{numeric()}\cr Reference point as a vector of numerical
values.}

\item{maximise}{\code{logical()}\cr Whether the objectives must be maximised
instead of minimised. Either a single logical value that applies to all
objectives or a vector of logical values, with one value per objective.}
}
\value{
\code{numeric(1)} A single numerical value.
}
\description{
Compute the hypervolume metric with respect to a given reference point
assuming minimization of all objectives.

\details{
The hypervolume of a set of multidimensional points \eqn{A \subset
\mathbb{R}^d}{A in R^m} with respect to a reference point \eqn{\vec{r} \in
\mathbb{R}^d}{r in R^m} is the volume of the region dominated by the set and
bounded by the reference point \citep{ZitThi1998ppsn}.  Points in \eqn{A}
that do not strictly dominated \eqn{\vec{r}} do not contribute to the
hypervolume value, thus, ideally, the reference point must be strictly
dominated by all points in the true Pareto front.

More precisely, the hypervolume is the Lebesgue integral of the union of
axis-aligned hyperrectangles
(\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperrectangle}{orthotopes}), where each
hyperrectangle is defined by one point from \eqn{\vec{a} \in A} and the
reference point.  The union of axis-aligned hyperrectangles is also called
an \emph{orthogonal polytope}.

The hypervolume is compatible with Pareto-optimality
\citep{KnoCor2002cec,ZitThiLauFon2003:tec}, that is, \eqn{\nexists A,B
\subset \mathbb{R}^m}{it does not exist A,B subsets of R^d}, such that
\eqn{A} is better than \eqn{B} in terms of Pareto-optimality and
\eqn{\text{hyp}(A) \leq \text{hyp}(B)}{hyp(A) <= hyp(B)}. In other words, if
a set is better than another in terms of Pareto-optimality, the hypervolume
of the former must be strictly larger than the hypervolume of the latter.
Conversely, if the hypervolume of a set is larger than the hypervolume of
another, then we know for sure than the latter set cannot be better than the
former in terms of Pareto-optimality.

For 2D and 3D, the algorithms used
\citep{FonPaqLop06:hypervolume,BeuFonLopPaqVah09:tec} have \eqn{O(n \log n)}
complexity, where \eqn{n} is the number of input points. The 3D case uses
the \eqn{\text{HV3D}^{+}} algorithm \citep{GueFon2017hv4d}, which has the
sample complexity as the HV3D algorithm
\citep{FonPaqLop06:hypervolume,BeuFonLopPaqVah09:tec}, but it is faster in
practice.

For 4D, the algorithm used is \eqn{\text{HV4D}^{+}} \citep{GueFon2017hv4d},
which has \eqn{O(n^2)} complexity.  Compared to the \href{https://github.com/apguerreiro/HVC/}{original implementation}, this implementation
correctly handles weakly dominated points and has been further optimized for
speed.

For 5D or higher, it uses a recursive algorithm that has the 3D algorithm as
a base case algorithm \citep{FonPaqLop06:hypervolume}, which has
\eqn{O(n^{m-2} \log n)} time and linear space complexity in the worst-case,
where \eqn{m} is the dimension of the points, but experimental results show
that the pruning techniques used may reduce the time complexity even
further.  Andreia P. Guerreiro improved the integration of the 3D case with
the recursive algorithm, which leads to significant reduction of computation
time. She has also enhanced the numerical stability of the algorithm by
avoiding floating-point comparisons of partial hypervolumes.
