Ways to Contribute to the Development of moocore
================================================

There are a lot of ways you can contribute:

1. Contribute code:
    The code is available at https://github.com/multi-objective/moocore/ .
    Feel free to fork the project and create a pull request.

2. Comments/suggestions on the :ref:`api_reference`:
    What functionality is missing? What would be useful APIs of existing functionality? What code/algorithms would be useful to implement?

3. Improvements to the documentation:
     A goal of ``moocore`` is to have up-to-date, detailed and informative documentation such as :ref:`unary_quality_metrics`.

4. Interesting :ref:`auto_examples`
     For example, tutorials about multi-objective optimization, interesting applications, etc.

5. Adding other languages, such as MATLAB, Java, Julia, Rust, etc.
     There is also a  `moocore R package <https://multi-objective.github.io/moocore/r>`_.
     And the C code can be used as a library.
