Functions by topic
******************

In this chapter functions docstrings are presented, grouped by functionality.
Many docstrings contain example code, which demonstrates basic usage
of the function. The examples assume that moocore is imported with::

  >>> import moocore

A convenient way to execute examples is the ``%doctest_mode`` mode of
IPython, which allows for pasting of multi-line examples and preserves
indentation.
