Introduction
============

The goal of **moocore** is to collect and document fast implementations of core mathematical functions and algorithms for multi-objective optimization. These functions include:

 * Generate and transform nondominated sets.
 * Identify and filter dominated vectors.
 * Quality metrics such as (weighted) hypervolume, epsilon, IGD, etc.
 * Computation of the Empirical Attainment Function. The empirical attainment function (EAF) describes the probabilistic
distribution of the outcomes obtained by a stochastic algorithm in the
objective space.

**Keywords**: empirical attainment function, summary attainment surfaces, EAF
differences, multi-objective optimization, bi-objective optimization,
performance measures, performance assessment

For more details, see the complete [Documentation][py-moocore-homepage].

Install
-------

You can install the [latest release](https://pypi.org/project/moocore/) using `pip`, for example:

```bash
python3 -m pip install moocore
```

Or to build the latest development version from GitHub:

```bash
python3 -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/multi-objective/moocore.git#egg=moocore&subdirectory=python'
```

Building the development version requires a C/C++ compiler. Instead, you can install pre-compiled development wheels for your operating system. See the list of wheels here (https://github.com/multi-objective/moocore/tree/wheels), click in the wheel you wish to install then copy the **View Raw** link. For example,

```bash
python3 -m pip install https://github.com/multi-objective/moocore/raw/refs/heads/wheels/moocore-0.1.5.dev0-py3-none-macosx_10_9_universal2.whl
```

If the URL does not have the word `raw` then you are not using the **View Raw** link.


R package
---------

There is also a `moocore` package for R: https://multi-objective.github.io/moocore/r
