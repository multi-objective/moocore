This reference manual details functions, modules, and objects
included in ``moocore``, describing what they are and what they do.
For learning how to use moocore, see the :ref:`complete documentation <moocore_docs_mainpage>`.

Many docstrings contain example code, which demonstrates basic usage
of the function. The examples assume that moocore is imported with::

  >>> import moocore

A convenient way to execute examples is the ``%doctest_mode`` mode of
IPython, which allows for pasting of multi-line examples and preserves
indentation.
